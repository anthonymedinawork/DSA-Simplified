# DSA Simplified - Design by Engineers for Engineers
This is your One stop shop for all DSA queries! Here you will find implementation of all sorts of data structures and algorithms. These are the 3 steps I followed in my DSA journey.
1. Implement algorithms by yourself (ask questions, why method runs for O(n) time complexity, why do I need extra space to make it better)
2. **Problem Solving** - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is your answer, Initially nothing will make sense, don't worry this is just a start. 
>Read the question and try to make sense, design your third class solution which won't even pass 5 test cases. Point is it doesn't matter if you don't have a solution
but now you are able to think based on the problem, this practice will help you to understand patterns. Now go to the solution tab or come here to look for the solution and copy paste entire logic, No one is judging you. What you need to do is debug the solution and figure out what the missing puzzle was. Guess what next time when you come across the same pattern you'll know what to do. This is how I learned how to use remainder %. That's one pattern, slowly you'd be able to figure out when to use Trie or Union-Find. Stay consistent and code for good.
